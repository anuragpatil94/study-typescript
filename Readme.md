## Type System

### Advantages

- Helps us catch errors during development
- 👤 Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
- Only active during development
- ❌Doesn't provide any performance optimization

## Packages

- typescript
- ts-node

## Commands

- `tsc -v` -> Typescirpt Compiler

### Run Typescript

- Compile the file `tsc file.ts`
- Compile file is `file.js`. Run the file as `node file.js`

> ts-node will combile both the commands at the same time. So, we don't have to write command 2 times.

- Command - `ts-node file.ts`

## Steps

1. Make a network request to fetch some JSON and print the result
   How Typescript handles errors

## Goals

### Syntax + Features
  
- Understand basic types in TS
- Function typing + annotations
- Type definition files
- Arrays in TS
- Modules Systems
- Classes + Refresher on OOP
- What is an interface?
- What is the syntax for defining an interface?

### Design Patterns with TS
  
- Projects
- How do we use interfaces to write reusable code?
